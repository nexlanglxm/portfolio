# The Neil Project

***

Here I have some of the projects that I am working on in my own time

## Spotify, APIs & Spotipy

> I am going to develope a Python program that interacts with the Spotify API to generate personalized playlists for users based on their music preferences. Users will be bale to input their favourite artists, genres or songs, and the aim of this program is that it will interact with the Spotify API to create a playlist according to the choices they have made.
>This will involve working with user input, data manipulation, and playlist creation.
> I will also have to consider how demanding the program becomes
